=head1 NAME

mite_shim - Produce a Mite::Shim file for your project

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    mite_shim <shim package name> > lib/Your/Mite.pm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In order to be able to run without having L<Mite> installed, your
project needs a "shim" module to load the compiled Mite code and
provide dummy versions of C<has> and the like.

This generates that shim.

It changes the package name to fit your project, so multiple versions
of the shim can be loaded at the same time.
