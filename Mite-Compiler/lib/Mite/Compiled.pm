package Mite::Compiled;

=head1 NAME

Mite::Compiled - The extra class file written by Mite.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mite::Compiled;
    my $compiled = Mite::Compiled->new( source => $source );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the extra file written by Mite containing the compiled code.

There is a one-to-one mapping between a source file and a compiled
file, but there can be many Mite classes in one file.  Mite::Compiled
manages the compliation and ensures classes don't write over each
other.
