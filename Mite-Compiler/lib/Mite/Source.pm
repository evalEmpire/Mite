package Mite::Source;

=head1 NAME

Mite::Source - Representing the human written .pm file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mite::Source;
    my $source = Mite::Source->new( file => $pm_filename );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a .pm file, written by a human, which uses Mite.

It is responsible for information about the source file.

* The Mite classes contained in the source.
* The compiled Mite file associated with it.

It delegates most work to other classes.

This object is necessary because there can be multiple Mite classes in
one source file.
