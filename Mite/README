NAME
    Mite - Moose-like OO with no dependencies

SYNOPSIS
        package Foo;

        # Mite roles do not require anything special to use
        use Foo::Some::Role;

        # Load the Mite shim
        use Foo::Mite;

        # Subclass of Bar
        extends "Bar";

        # A read/write string attribute
        has "attribute";

        # A read-only integer attribute with a default
        has another_attribute => (
            is      => 'ro',
            type    => 'Int',
            default => 1
        );

DESCRIPTION
    Moose and Mouse are great... unless you can't have any dependencies or
    compile-time is critical.

    Mite provides Moose-like functionality, but it does all the work at
    build time. New source code is written which contains your accessors and
    roles.

    Mite is not compatible with Moose, but it tries to stick as close as
    possible.

    Mite is for a very narrow set of use cases. Unless you specifically need
    ultra-fast startup time or no dependencies, use Moose or Mouse.

  How To Use It
   1. Install Mite::Compiler
    Only developers must have Mite::Compiler installed. Install it normally
    from CPAN.

   2a. Depend on Mite
    Add Mite into your runtime dependencies. This is a very small module
    which loads the compiled Mite code.

    Or if you want no dependencies at all...

   2b. Inject the Mite::Shim into your source code
    Run the "mite_shim" program to generate the shim. Tell it the name you
    want to give to the shim. Put it into your lib directory.

        mite_shim 'Foo::Mite' > lib/Foo/Mite.pm

   3. Run "mite" when you change your code.
    Mite is "compiled" in that the code must be processed after editing
    before you run it. This is done with the "mite" program.

   4. Make sure the mite files are in your MANIFEST
    The compiled Foo.mite files must ship with your code, so make sure they
    get picked up in your MANIFEST file.

   5. Ship normally
    Build and ship your distribution normally. It contains everything it
    needs.

  Exported Functions
   extends
        extends @classes;

    Declares this is a subclass of @classes.

   has
        has $name => %args;

    Declares an object attribute named $name.

    See Attributes for details.

  Provided Methods
    See Mite::Object for full details of what a Mite class can do. Here are
    some of the basics.

   meta
        my $meta = $obj->meta;
        my $meta = Class->meta;

    Returns the meta object for the class. Used for introspection.

    See Mite::Meta for what you can do with the meta object.

   new
        my $obj = Class->new( \%args );

    Constructs a new instance of the "Class".

    Arguments are passed in as a hash ref.

    "new()" accepts attributes as its arguments.

        my $obj = Foo->new(
            attribute               => "Foo",
            another_attribute       => 42
        );

   override_attribute
        Class->meta->override_attribute( name => \%args );

    Allows a subclass to change how an inherited attribute works.

    The %args are the same as has.

        # Baz is a subclass of Foo
        # Give Baz->attribute a default
        Baz->override_attribute( attribute => {
            default         => 'woof'
        });

WHY IS THIS
    This module exists for a very "special" set of use cases. Authors of
    toolchain modules (Test::More, ExtUtils::MakeMaker, File::Spec, etc...)
    who cannot easily depend on other CPAN modules. It would cause a
    circular dependency and add instability to CPAN. These authors are
    frustrated at not being able to use most of the advances in Perl present
    on CPAN, such as Moose.

    To add to their burden, by being used by almost everyone, toolchain
    modules limit how fast modules can load. So they have to compile very
    fast. They do not have the luxury of creating attributes and including
    roles at compile time. It must be baked in.

    Finally, Moose and Mouse both require role users and subclassers to also
    be Moose or Mouse classes. This is a dangerous encapsulation breach of
    an implementation detail. It means the class, and its subclasses, are
    stuck using Moose or Mouse forever.

SEE ALSO
    Mite::Compiler is what you need to develop with Mite.

    Mouse is a forward-compatible version of Moose with no dependencies.

    Moose is the complete Perl 5 OO module which this is all based on.
