=head1 NAME

Mite - Moose-like OO, fast to load, with zero dependencies.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ mite init Foo

    $ cat lib/Foo.pm
    package Foo;

    # Load the Mite shim
    use Foo::Mite;

    # Subclass of Bar
    extends "Bar";

    # A read/write string attribute
    has attribute =>
        is      => 'rw';

    # A read-only attribute with a default
    has another_attribute =>
        is      => 'ro',
        default => 1;

    $ mite compile

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mite provides a subset of Moose features with very fast startup time
and zero dependencies.

L<Moose> and L<Mouse> are great... unless you can't have any
dependencies or compile-time is critical.

Mite provides Moose-like functionality, but it does all the work
during development.  New source code is written which contains the OO
code.  Your project does not have to depend on Mite.  Nor does your
project have to spend time during startup to build OO features.

Mite is for a very narrow set of use cases.  Unless you specifically
need ultra-fast startup time or zero dependencies, use L<Moose> or
L<Mouse>.

=head2 How To Use It

=head3 1. Install Mite

Only developers must have Mite installed.  Install it normally from
CPAN.

Do not declare Mite as a dependency.  It is not needed to install your
release.

=head3 2. mite init <Your::Project>

Initialize your project.  Tell it your project name.

This will create a F<.mite> directory and a shim file in F<lib>.

=head3 3. Write your code using your mite shim.

Instead of C<use Mite>, you should C<use Your::Project::Mite>.  The
name of this file will depend on the name of your project.

L<Mite> is a subset of L<Moose>.

=head3 4. C<mite compile> after each change

Mite is "compiled" in that the code must be processed after editing
before you run it.  This is done by running C<mite compile>.  It will
create F<.mite.pm> files for each F<.pm> file in F<lib>.

To make development smoother, we provide utility modules to link Mite
with the normal build process.  See L<Mite::MakeMaker> and
L<Mite::ModuleBuild> for MakeMaker/F<Makefile.PL> and
Module::Build/F<Build.PL> development respectively.

=head3 5. Make sure the F<.mite> directory is not in your MANIFEST.

The F<.mite> directory should not be shipped with your distribution.
Add C<^\.mite$> to your F<MANIFEST.SKIP> file.

=head3 6. Make sure the mite files are in your MANIFEST.

The compiled F<.mite.pm> files must ship with your code, so make sure
they get picked up in your F<MANIFEST> file.  This should happen when
you build the F<MANIFEST> normally.

=head3 7. Ship normally

Build and ship your distribution normally.  It contains everything it
needs.


=head1 FEATURES

L<Mite> is a subset of L<Moose>.  These docs will only describe what
Moose features are implemented or where they differ.  For everything
else, please read L<Moose> and L<Moose::Manual>.

=head2 C<has>

Supports C<is> and C<default>.

=head2 C<extends>

Works as in L<Moose>.  Options are not implemented.

=head2 C<strict>

Mite will turn strict on for you.

=head2 C<warnings>

Mite will turn warnings on for you.


=head1 OPTIMIZATIONS

Mite writes pure Perl code and your module will run with no
dependencies.  It will also write code to use other, faster modules to
do the same job, if available.

These optimizations can be turned off by setting the C<MITE_PURE_PERL>
environment variable true.

You may wish to add these as recommended dependencies.

=head2 Class::XSAccessor

Mite will use L<Class::XSAccessor> for accessors if available.  They
are significantly faster than those written in Perl.

=head1 WHY IS THIS

This module exists for a very special set of use cases.  Authors of
toolchain modules (Test::More, ExtUtils::MakeMaker, File::Spec,
etc...) who cannot easily depend on other CPAN modules.  It would
cause a circular dependency and add instability to CPAN.  These
authors are frustrated at not being able to use most of the advances
in Perl present on CPAN, such as Moose.

To add to their burden, by being used by almost everyone, toolchain
modules limit how fast modules can load.  So they have to compile very
fast.  They do not have the luxury of creating attributes and
including roles at compile time.  It must be baked in.

Use Mite if your project cannot have non-core dependencies or needs to
load very quickly.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Mouse> is a very fast and rather complete subset of Moose with no
dependencies.

L<Moose> is the complete Perl 5 OO module which this is all based on.
